					The philosopher Jaques Derrida remarked that "there is no
					out-of-context" <i>(il n'y a pas de hors-texte)</i> or everything in
					context. We are all defined by our histories; they shape who we are,
					how we see the world and how we interact. If we wish to truly
					communicate, we must incorporate those histories into our awareness â€“
					take stock of our own preconceptions, how they influence us, as well
					as realizing that the histories of others may shape how they receive
					the information we impart.

				<Typography variant="body2" color="textSecondary" component="p">
					Masterpieces begin as scribbles. Pursuing answers leads to stronger
					results than focusing on the one answer. Distilling down to the
					essence inspires a team whereas dictating the outcome restrains
					creativity. Ownership leads to productivity.

					Break bias with action; although a bias cannot literally be broken, by
					breaking out of comfort zones we can begin to set new patterns and to
					understand the difficulties other may be facing in doing so. Through
					improvisation and physical theater exercises, we will challenge
					ourselves and encourage our team members to be present together in
					this moment, to go a little further than we thought we could.
