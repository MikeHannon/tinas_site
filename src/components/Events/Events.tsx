					While pursuing my MFA at UW, I facilitated a discussion on ethics and
					best practices for the neurology department at Seattle Children’s
					hospital using The Study (or Reading to Vegetables) by E. M. Lewis,
					which was inspired by Stanley Milgram’s "obedience" experiments in the
					1960’s. One of the many themes we explored was when should our morals
					override authority, how mutable or immutable is that line, what is the
					greater good? A short trailer can be found{" "}

					Seattle Pacific University’s Innovation Grant allowed me to further
					explore how multi-lingual, multi-discipline theatre influences
					conversation. The discussion that followed the performance covered
					ways to navigate mental illness, how to cope with loss, race and
					representation in casting, the effects of hearing one’s language
					onstage, dramaturgical approach to “updating” this play and music’s
					role in creating empathy. We openly involved our whole team with the

					Run for Your Wife by Ray Cooney

				<Typography variant="body2" color="textSecondary" component="p">
					Not every conversation starter has to be a heady dive into morality.
					Often a good laugh is just as effective. Physical comedy, often based
					around the best of intentions gone awry, has always had a draw for me.
					Our production was inspired by the physical theater in I love Lucy -
					comedy from the head and the heart. (And sometimes laughter is
					profitable). Our rendition of Run for Your Wife was Los Angeles's
					Morgan Wixson Theater’s highest grossing production. A short teaser
					can be seen{" "}
